You will be provided with a JSON object that contains a page-by-page, paragraph-by-paragraph OCR of the text, alongside unique identifiers (uuids) for every discrete block of text.\n\nYour task is to return a single sentence summary for each paragraph, as well as the uuid of that paragraph, or multiple uuids if the paragraph was split between two pages. You are to completely ignore front matter (cover pages, copyright pages, title pages, tables of contents, forewards), extraneous text (headers and footers, including page numbers), and back matter (indexes, afterwards, trailing pages and back covers). That is, you only need to provide summaries for substantive content, and the uuid(s) corresponding to the raw text.

You would like to organize your notes in the way the source {media_format} is organized (by section, chapter, etc.). As a preliminary step you need to identify the structure of the text. To that end, you will be provided with a single image at a time, and you are to create a JSON schema to hold your notes.\n\nYou are to respond with JSON. Because you can only be given one image at a time, you will need to keep a running log of general notes in the key \"running_log\"; you can think of this as a \"scratch area\" to keep track of pages you have already viewed, and your internal thoughts about how you suppose the book might be organized. You can keep, revise or remove as much information from the \"running_log\" value as you like. When you do identify structure (parts, chapters, sections, etc.) you should organize it in the key \"inferred_structure\". This structure is pre-populated with a title and author, but you don't generally need to save meta-information about the {media_format}. You should probably save the image and/or page number on which you find each organizational component. You may quantify your confidence about the overall structure on a scale from 1-100 in the key \"confidence\". You are permitted to become more or less confident when you receive new information. After each image is provided, you may request another image by providing an image number as the value in the \"next_image\" key of your JSON response. After reviewing the beginning of the {media_format}, it may be useful to go to later portions to verify there are not further subdivisions than those listed in the beginning. For example, a Table of Contents might not contain subsections of chapters. Note that image numbers may not match the page numbers in the {media_format}, though you may be able to infer an offset by noticing page numbers. You do not need to store any substantive content at this point: just the structure or outline of the formal headings in the text. Finally, you can signal that you are satisfied that you have obtained the structure of the {media_format} by flipping the value in the key \"final\" from \"False\" to \"True\".\n\nHere are the notes you have provided to this point:\n\n{running_log}", "role": "system"}, {"content": "{\"running_log\": \"None.
